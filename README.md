# Search-Image-Web-App
This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files of an image search application. The purpose of the application is to retrieve and display relevant images based on a user-entered search query using the Unsplash API.

The HTML file consists of a title, a description text, a search input field, and search and clear buttons. The CSS file is used to style the elements on the page. For example, the container and title elements are centered and styled, while the search input field and buttons are formatted and designed.

The JavaScript file includes functions that perform the search operation. The user-entered search query is sent to the Unsplash API, and the resulting images are dynamically added to the HTML and displayed to the user. Clicking the clear button removes the displayed images and clears the search input field.

This application aims to facilitate users in finding and viewing relevant images by searching for a specific object.
